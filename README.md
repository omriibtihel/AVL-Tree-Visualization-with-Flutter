# AVL-Tree-Visualization-with-Flutter
This Flutter project provides a visual representation of an AVL Tree data structure, complete with functionality to insert, delete, and search for nodes. The project uses custom animations to visualize the balancing and rotations that occur in an AVL Tree.

Features
Insertion: Add nodes to the AVL Tree, maintaining balance through rotations.
Deletion: Remove nodes from the AVL Tree, with automatic re-balancing.
Search: Find nodes within the AVL Tree, with visual feedback.
Animation: Smooth animations to demonstrate the tree's balancing operations.

Technologies Used
Flutter: Framework for building the user interface and handling animations.
Dart: Programming language used for implementing the AVL Tree logic and custom painting.

Project Structure
main.dart: Entry point of the application, sets up the main widget and handles user interactions.
avl_tree.dart: Contains the AVL Tree implementation, including insertion, deletion, and balancing logic.
CirclePainter.dart: Custom painter for drawing the AVL Tree nodes and edges on the canvas.
